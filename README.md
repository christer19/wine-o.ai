# WINE-O.AI: computer vision assisted wine recommendations

by Michelle L. Gill, Ph.D.  

This is the home of [WINE-O.AI](http://wine-o.ai), a computer vision-based wine label search and recommendation application. This project was completed for my passion project at [Metis](http://thisismetis.com) Summer 2016 Data Science Bootcamp. WINE-O.AI uses computer vision, natural language processing, collaborative filtering, and D3 for visualization.

## Presentation

The project was presented on September 15, 2016 at Career Night. A [video](http://wineoai.michellelynngill.com/presentation/WINE-O_AI_MLGill.m4v) and [PDF](http://wineoai.michellelynngill.com/presentation/WINE-O_AI_MLGill.pdf) of the presentation slides is available.

## Blog Post

A blog post on [themodernscientist](http://themodernscientist.com) will be available the week of 2016/10/03. This text will be updated when the website is posted.
